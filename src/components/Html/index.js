                If you were building a house, youd probably want it to have things like....
                walls right? What about doors, a roof, basement, windows? The same is true of a webpage,
                but instead of there being walls and a roof, there is HTML. HTML is the skeleton of a webpage for everything
                else to rest upon and be acted upon. Without HTML, a webpage would cease to exist. There would
                be no headers, content, or buttons. If you want to give your webpage walls, take a look at this
                HTML handbook for some basics.

        </section>
