            <p>Welcome to my code handbook! This React application was written and 
                designed to be my personal go to handbook on how to write code, and also functionally
                learn to write code as I go. The site is in it's development phase as of now, but I 
                will continue to update it with entries and lessons as time goes on! Thanks for visiting!
